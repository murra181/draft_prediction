# Draft Prediction

## Overview

Taking information from the top 200 players that enter the combine we will cross refrence this with high school recruiting and college career stats to predict both what pick or what round they would be picked in.


## The Data

Data was taken from Stathead.com for the combine.  This was limited to 200 players by the website out of the around 300 invited every year.

Data for collge season stats and high school ratings were gathered by college football data api

Combine stats span from 2001 to 2015

Season stats span from 1997 to 2015

High school recruiting spans from 2000 to 2015 because the api only goes back to 2000


## EDA

Our data was skewed to more recent players since high school recruiting data was not as available from the api.

Most limiting data group was the combnine data that was held to just 3000 to begin with.

After all data was combined and refined we were left with just 936 players to build our model off of.
